// dashboard.js - For fetching and managing live orders

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    console.log("Dashboard script loaded!");
    // --- Future Logic Here ---
    // 1. Fetch live orders from a backend API.
    // 2. Dynamically create order cards and append them to the dashboard-orders-container.
    // 3. Add event listeners to "Acknowledge", "Mark as Completed", "Mark as Resolved" buttons.
    // 4. Send updates back to the backend when order status changes.
